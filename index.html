		<h1>Learning Plan</h1>
		<div>
			<p>
				My learning plan is to work without distractions, but have short breaks to avoid stress and exhaustion, learn from others and teach them what I learn, be patient, self-taught and constant, motivate myself and my colleagues, be empathic and kind. Obtain information through reading and writing to improve the quality of learning that I get every day, rescuing the most important concepts that contribute to my development as a professional in the workplace.
